  <h1>Applications of Computing in Weather Modelling</h1>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Collecting data is the first part of predicting future weather. This is
    gathered by:
  </p>
  <ul type="circles">
    <li>Satellites</li>
    <li>Weather Stations</li>
    <li>Radar</li>
    <li>Remote Buoys</li>
    <li>Weather Balloons</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These collect data such as:</p>
  <ul type="circles">
    <li>Temperature</li>
    <li>Wind speed & direction</li>
    <li>Pressure</li>
    <li>Humidity</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Data Processing</h2>
  <p>
    The next step is optimising and processing the data. This is called data
    assimilation. It is required because of the large volumes of global data
    collected. Machine learning is then used to create models of weather
    patterns, and neural networks are used to predict weather in advance.
  </p>

  <h2>Using the models</h2>
  <p>
    Weather maps are created, and these allow for local weather to be fitted
    into a larger weather system. In the UK, the
    <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">Met Office</a> model weather and
    release forecasts for the public. These models can help to predict extreme
    weather events, which allow for preparation for hurricanes, tornadoes,
    snowstorms and more. This means that authorities can call for evacuations or
    put protection in place to prevent damage or loss of life. Also, accurate
    weather predictions can allow industries, particularly agrictulture, to
    prepare and put measures in place to protect their business.

  <h2>Hardware and Model Refinement</h2>
  <p>
    Some of the fastest supercomputers in the world are used in this field, as
    there are very large amounts of data to process. These computers are able to
    run near-realistic simulations and the models are being finetuned and
    improved constantly. In many cases, multiple different 'expert' models are
    run on the same data, and all combined to create a consensus prediction of
    the future weather. There is a constant cycle occuring daily to constantly
    improve prediction:
